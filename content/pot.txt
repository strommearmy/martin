<h2>If your town bans pot shops, should it get tax revenue?<h2>

Who should share in the spoils of the new recreational marijuana industry? If pro-pot advocates get their way, it won’t be any of the more than 100 municipalities that have enacted bans, moratoriums, or tight limits on licensed marijuana operations.

Proponents of legalized marijuana are planning to push the Legislature to block cities and towns with such restrictions from receiving a single dime of the $150 million-plus in tax revenue the state could soon collect from retail cannabis sales.


It’s a long-shot idea, but backers hope there’s appeal in its moral simplicity. Their argument amounts to the familiar parable of the Little Red Hen: Why should those who refused to help bake the bread get to eat it?

“Municipalities shouldn’t be entitled to something they took no part in,” said Kamani Jefferson, who runs the Mass. Recreational Consumer Council. The proposal, he explained, “would force their hand and really encourage them to let these businesses in.”
