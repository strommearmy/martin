Officials in Salem are searching for the person responsible for vandalizing the Salem State University baseball field with blatantly racist and pro-Donald Trump graffiti on Friday.

“Trump #1 Whites Only USA” and “Whites #1” were found spray-painted on benches and a fence surrounding the field Friday morning, according to photos from the scene. Another bench had graffiti that used the n-word and said “DIE.”

Two days after the graffiti was found, it remained an “active criminal investigation,” Salem State president John Keenan said in a statement Sunday.

If a student is found to be responsible, Keenan said, the punishment would be “immediate dismissal from the university and referral to the Commonwealth for potential criminal prosecution.”
